/*
 * 📚 Section: JavaScript Refresher – Coding Environment Setup
 * 🔧 Type: Code-Oriented (Sandbox-based project)
 * 📌 Purpose: Set up a minimal project for JS practice and refresh key concepts used in React
 */

// ✅ What is provided?
const sandboxEnvironment = {
  platform: "CodeSandbox",
  files: ["index.html", "assets folder"],
  code: "No JavaScript code initially",
  output: "Will use the browser console for most output"
};


// 🧪 How will you practice?
// This section is hands-on but focused on console-based experiments,
// NOT building real-world projects yet.

const isProjectBased = false;
const isConsoleFocused = true;


// 🧠 Why console-based?
// This refresher section is designed to quickly and clearly demonstrate
// JavaScript fundamentals without the distraction of building full interfaces.

const learningStyle = "Practice-by-console";

// 🔍 Where is console in CodeSandbox?
// Click on the "Console" tab in the lower section of the CodeSandbox UI.


// 🚀 Quick Example:

// In your JS file:
console.log("Hello JavaScript Refresher!");

// Output will show in the Console tab
// Useful for testing small concepts like variables, loops, functions, etc.


// ✅ Why this setup?
// You don’t need to worry about HTML structure or UI yet —
// focus 100% on JavaScript syntax, logic, and behavior.

const goal = "Give you a simple workspace to safely review and test JavaScript concepts you'll use in React";
